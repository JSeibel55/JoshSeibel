                            The <a href="https://geography.wisc.edu/cartography/index.html">UW Madison Cartography Lab</a> 
                            holds the annual Cart Lab Design Challenge which is a one-day mapping workshop that challenges 
                            students to create and then present on a map within an eight hour stretch. The 2020 UW Cart Lab Design Challenge 
                            was themed around Spending a Day in the Newsroom. This challenge allowed students to experience mapping 
                            the news through discussing potential news issues that could have map component to the story, designing how they 
                            could be mapped, creating the map, and finally presnting the map.

                            For this challenge, I worked with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hayley-corson-dosch/">Hayley Corson-Dosch</a> 
                            to create a map about the Australian wildfires and their environmental impacts. In the later part of 2019 and early 
                            part of 2020, Australia experienced unprecedented wildfires in the eastern part of the country. Many of which were 
                            located around the city of Sydney. Through our brief research, we learned that the Burragorang Reservoir holds 80% 
                            of Sydney's drinking water. A little over a million acres of the water catchment that refills the reservoir has burned, 
                            a majority of which surrounds the reservoir. Fires followed by large rainfall events (which occured after the wildfire subsided) 
                            cause the burned sediment to wash ino Lake Burragorang. This could be a potential issue for the people of Sydney as the 
                            burned organic material (organic carbon and phosphorous) react in the water and produce toxins. This can lead to serious 
                            water quality impacts including deoxygenation and the growth of cyanobacteria and algae.
